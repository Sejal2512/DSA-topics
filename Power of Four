Power of Four

Question Link


Problem Statement :

Given an integer n, return true if it is a power of four. Otherwise, return false.

An integer n is a power of four, if there exists an integer x such that n == 4x.
 
Examples:

Example 1:

Input: n = 16
Output: true
 

Example 2:

Input: n = 5
Output: false

Constraints:
2^31 <= n <= 2^31 - 1



   Pseudocode:
Define a function isPowerofFour that takes an integer n as input and returns a boolean.
Check if the expression (n & (n - 1)) == 0 is true:
This condition checks if n is a power of 2, meaning it has only one bit set. If it's true, it indicates that n is a power of 2.
Check if the expression n % 3 == 1 is true:
This condition checks if n modulo 3 is equal to 1. If it's true, it indicates that n is in the form 4k.
Return the result of the logical AND operation between the results of the two conditions in step 2 and step 3. If both conditions are true, it indicates that n is a power of 4



Code for the problem:-
 

Java Code

class Solution {
    public boolean isPowerOfFour(int n) {
      return ((n&(n-1))==0 && n%3==1);
    }
}


Another code:-

class Solution {
    public boolean isPowerOfFour(int n) {
        if (n <= 0) return false;          
        while (n % 4 == 0) {               
            n /= 4;
        }
        return n == 1;                     
    }
}
