Problem Statement :

Given a string date representing a Gregorian calendar date formatted as YYYY-MM-DD, return the day number of the year.


Examples:
 

Example 1:

Input: date = "2019-01-09"
Output: 9
Explanation: Given date is the 9th day of the year in 2019.
 

Example 2:

Input: date = "2019-02-10"
Output: 41.


Constraints:
date.length == 10
date[4] == date[7] == '-', and all other date[i]‘s are digits
date represents a calendar date between Jan 1, 1900 and Dec 31, 2019.


   Pseudocode:
Define a function dayOfYear that takes a string date as input and returns an integer.
Create an array arr containing the number of days in each month except February (assuming it's not a leap year).
Split the input date string by "-" to extract the year, month, and day.
Convert the extracted year, month, and day strings into integers.
Initialize a variable totalDays to store the total number of days, initially set to the day of the month.
Iterate over the months before the current month:
Add the number of days in each month to the totalDays.
Check if the month is greater than 2 and if the year is a leap year (divisible by 4) and either divisible by 400 or not divisible by 100:
If true, increment totalDays by 1 to account for the leap day in February.
Return the totalDays



Code for the problem:-
 

Java Code

class Solution {
    public int dayOfYear(String date) {
    int[] arr = {31,28,31,30,31,30,31,31,30,31,30,31};
      String[] monthD = date.split("-");
        int year = Integer.parseInt(monthD[0]);
        int month = Integer.parseInt(monthD[1]);
        int days = Integer.parseInt(monthD[2]);
        int totalDays = days;
        for(int i=0;i<month-1;i++){
            totalDays = totalDays+arr[i];
        }
        if(month>2 && year%4==0 && (year%400==0 || year%100!=0)){
            totalDays = totalDays+1;
        }
        return totalDays;
        }
}
